Heyyy Baby,
I love you so much. You are the best and most special person in the world.
I love you I love you I love you. There are so many other things i want to tell you, however, i cant fit everything inside this one note. Ive spread 13 files saying one word. Go find them. No clues or nothing. Find all 13, and then, after all that is done, look at the words of each note, and peice them together in order of the dates the files are titled with. This will make a extra 13 word message i want to say to you.

Theres also loads of files randomly scattered with extra messages x

Ill be honest theres loads of easter eggs
go find them all
