# Hello Again

Its been a long time since your last mission, and today i have a very important one for you. Someone called Abdellah has a package that needs to be delivered to a woman name Zubaidah Ahmed, and he needs your help delivering it.

Okay lets get straight into it. Abdellah has been trying to deliver this message for a while now, so we need to move quickly.

1. we need to get ourselves a folder so that we can organise all this stuff from now on. This isnt part of the message but will help us moving forward

get ready to copy in some codes into your terminal app:

-- Open terminal and type in the following

```bash
cd Desktop
```

(Im assuming youll want it there. dont worry if youd like it moved i can sort that out for you when we next meet irl at our secret loaction (https://maps.app.goo.gl/rqDiSGoyqwpW47dR9)(if you found that cute please like and subscribe pls pls))

now copy in the following command

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amekhalfia04/ForZubaidah.git
```

This should set a folder that mirrors the github on ur computer, so that downloading files etc is a lot smoother

(click [this](https://youtu.be/-aaFi9QrS_Y?si=mneXkHDJiXtu3alg&t=74) lol)(Please imagine me saying it and u are the person on the other end x)(this is really fun that i can give u friends references now hee hee)

ANYWAY
back to the main mission at hand

So, the package is an encrypted file that has been super protected. it has been placed within a folder maze that runs really deep.

Im hoping that youre reading this initial message on the internet, so hopefully you have already done the steps above. Head to the folder we cloned and is now in your desktop, and head to the Mission 2 folder, and then head into the PACKAGE FOR ZUBAIDAH FOLDER.

Okay, so now you have the folder open in finder, youre going to refer to it whilst taking instructions from here:

Step 1: head to the folder that matches ur initials
Okay, dont be scared by the amount of folders here. We had to make sure it was secure, and so weve hidden the file somewhere allong the maze of folders.

Step 2: Now head to the folder that matches my intials please. (you know who i am ðŸ«£)

Step 3: Now head to the folder that is the initials of both our courses. my course first then yours lol

Step 4 Enjoy your main note. Its not long however inside youll find more info
