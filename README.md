# ILoveZubaidah

Dear Gentle Reader,

I love Zubaidah. Finee, there, I said it. In fact, I love Zubaidah a lot. And it is allllll her fault. Who wouldn't love Zubaidah when she's the most lovable person ever. I love Zubaidah so much, and will love her for the rest of my life.

Okay, before we discuss why I love Zubaidah, let me say I love Zubaidah in a few different ways, some creative, some not but whatever, just enjoy them x. (btw if zubaidah is reading this then please read 'I love Zubaidah' as 'I love you'. thank you for your understanding. Im writing this as a 2 in 1; im both telling you how much i love you, and also telling the worl how much i love you. Yay)
